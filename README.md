# CBFKit: A Control Barrier Function Toolbox for Robotics Applications

CBFKit is a Python/ROS2 toolbox designed to facilitate safe planning and control for robotics applications, particularly in uncertain environments. The toolbox utilizes Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to provide formal safety guarantees while offering flexibility and ease of use. We additionally provide efficient JAX implementatio of Model Predictive path Integral (MPPI) with support for reach avoid specifications.

## Supported Models
CBFKit accommodates a range of control-affine system models:
- **Deterministic Continuous-time ODEs:** $\dot{x} = f(x) + g(x)u$
- **ODEs with Bounded Disturbances:** $\dot{x} = f(x) + g(x)u + Mw$
- **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs):** $dx = (f(x) + g(x)u)dt + \sigma(x)dw$

## Applications
CBFKit can be applied to diverse robotics applications, including:
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Ensure collision avoidance with static and dynamic obstacles.
- **Human-Robot Interaction:** Guarantee safety during collaborative tasks and physical interaction.
- **Manipulation:** Control robot arms while avoiding obstacles and joint limits.
- **Multi-Robot Coordination:** Coordinate the movement of multiple robots while maintaining safe distances and avoiding collisions.

## Installation
CBFKit is readily deployable via a Docker image. After setting up Docker (refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) for detailed instructions), proceed with one of the following methods:

### 1. VS Code DevContainer Launch
1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Click the green button at the bottom right of the window to launch the DevContainer.
3. All necessary components are pre-installed for immediate use.

### 2. Docker Command Line
1. Build the image:
   ```
   docker build -t cbfkit:latest -f Dockerfile.$(uname -m) .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -it --name container-name -v .:/workspace cbfkit:latest
   ```

## Start with Tutorials
Explore the `tutorials` directory to help you get started with CBFKit. Open the Python notebook in the `tutorials` directory to get started. The script `simulate_new_control_system.ipynb` automatically generates the controller, plant, and certificate function for a Van der Pol oscillator. It also generates ROS2 nodes for the plant, controller, sensor, and estimator. These serve as a starting point for developing your own CBF-based controller.

## Simulation Arhitecture 
- Every simulation must define a planner, nominal controller, and a controller where the output of planner is passed to nominal controller and the output of nominal controller is then passed to the controller.

## Examples
Several additional examples of how to use CBFkit to conduct full simulations of arbitrary dynamical systems are provided, including a unicycle robot, fixed-wing aerial vehicle, and more, all of which may be found in the ```examples``` folder. Any file contained within ```examples``` or any of its subdirectories whose name takes the form of ```*main.py``` is an executable example that may be referenced when a user is building their own application.

See below for the script used to simulate a unicycle robot navigating toward a goal set amidst three ellipsoidal obstacles, which may be found at ```examples/unicycle/vanilla_cbf_start_to_goal_main.py```:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

import cbfkit.systems.unicycle.models.olfatisaber2002approximate as unicycle
import cbfkit.simulation.simulator as sim
from cbfkit.controllers_and_planners.model_based.cbf_clf_controllers import (
    vanilla_cbf_clf_qp_controller as cbf_controller,
)
from cbfkit.controllers_and_planners.model_based.cbf_clf_controllers.utils.certificate_packager import (
    concatenate_certificates,
)
from cbfkit.controllers_and_planners.model_based.cbf_clf_controllers.utils.barrier_conditions import (
    zeroing_barriers,
)

# Simulation parameters
tf = 10.0
dt = 0.01
file_path = "examples/unicycle/start_to_goal/results/"

approx_unicycle_dynamics = unicycle.plant(l=1.0)
init_state = jnp.array([0.0, 0.0, jnp.pi / 4])
desired_state = jnp.array([2.0, 4.0, 0])
actuation_constraints = jnp.array([100.0, 100.0])  # Effectively, no control limits

approx_uniycle_nom_controller = unicycle.controllers.proportional_controller(
    dynamics=approx_unicycle_dynamics,
    Kp_pos=1,
    Kp_theta=0.01,
    desired_state=desired_state,
)

obstacles = [
    (1.0, 2.0, 0.0),
    (-1.0, 1.0, 0.0),
    (0.5, -1.0, 0.0),
]
ellipsoids = [
    (0.5, 1.5),
    (1.0, 0.75),
    (0.75, 0.5),
]

barriers = [
    unicycle.certificate_functions.barrier_functions.obstacle_ca(
        certificate_conditions=zeroing_barriers.linear_class_k(2.0),
        obstacle=obs,
        ellipsoid=ell,
    )
    for obs, ell in zip(obstacles, ellipsoids)
]
barrier_packages = concatenate_certificates(*barriers)

    control_limits=actuation_constraints,
    nominal_input=approx_uniycle_nom_controller,
    dynamics_func=approx_unicycle_dynamics,
    barriers=barrier_packages,
)

# Simulation imports
from cbfkit.integration import forward_euler as integrator
from cbfkit.sensors import perfect as sensor
from cbfkit.estimators import naive as estimator


x, u, z, p, data, data_keys = sim.execute(
    x0=init_state,
    dt=dt,
    num_steps=int(tf / dt),
    dynamics=approx_unicycle_dynamics,
    integrator=integrator,
    controller=controller,
    sensor=sensor,
    estimator=estimator,
    filepath=file_path + "vanilla_cbf_results",
)
```


## ROS2
The ROS2 nodes are generated in the `ros2` directory. The nodes are generated for the plant, controller, sensor, and estimator. This support is in the initial stage and will be improved soon.

To run the nodes, execute the following command in the `van_der_pol_oscillator` directory:
```bash
bash run_ros2_nodes.sh
```
The generated nodes interact as follows:
- The `plant_model` node simulates the physical system and publishes the system state.
- The `sensor` node receives the system state and adds noise to simulate real-world measurements.
- The `estimator` node receives the noisy measurements and estimates the true system state.
- The `controller` node receives the estimated state and computes the control input based on the CBF formulation.
